# PH525x-notes
This repository contains .R scripts and .txt R console transcripts to record my progress through the PH525x genomics class (Rafael Irizarry, Michael Love Harvard) code worksheets.

Status: Chapter 3 (Robust Statistics) complete

Key learning progress:

Ch3:
- experimenting with robust statistics: spearman, MAD, wilcox
- filtering data (ChickWeight), adding outliers, generating and comparing boxplots

Ch2:
- when and how to use histogram, qq-plot, boxplot, scatterplot for exploratory data analyses
- univariate analysis vs 2D analysis
- stratifying 2-dimensional data

Ch1:
- understanding the theory behind statistics: CLT, Monte Carlo, t-distributions, confidence intervals, power
- using parametric simulations to generate population data
- modelling the null distribution to investigate differences between observed vs expected data (permutation tests, association tests)
